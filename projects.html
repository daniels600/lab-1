<h1>My Projects</h1>
<div class="project-body">
    My first project was modeling and building a complete database system for a Prison Management System. The database system keeps track of the both prisoners and staffs as well as Magistrate who judges the cases of conviction. Moving on to build a web application together with the database to improve it interactivity and usage. Other projects I'm working on are a Movie Trailer website where users can watch and have updates on all movies and trailers. And a visitor's lounge web application, this is to keep track of the visitors who visit a place and their agenda for the visit. Basically everything about visitors and who they visits.
